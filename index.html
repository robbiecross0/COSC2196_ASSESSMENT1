<h1>Interest In IT</h1>
<p>From a young age I've had an interest in IT, probably stemming from when our family first owned a PC once they were more affordable and prevalent in schools/homes (early 2000's). Learning basic HTML and being interested in video/music streaming platforms was also something I was interested in during my teens. From there throughout high school, and now professionally IT has been a hugely important in my life.</p>
<p>
Currently I'm working for a Software Company as a Client Manager mainly working with existing clients as well as new deployments and previously had experience in an IT degree at the University of Newcastle (prior to work commitments putting that on hiatus). Past roles professionally include working as a support analyst for a previous software company before moving into functional consulting which was my most previous role.</p>
<p>
I decided to start studying at RMIT in order to complete my degree I started in 2010, and also to learn some new skills and be introduced to current technologies, programs and ideas. Having a degree in my field will be important, but also ensuring that my skills and knowledge are up-to-date as working in the same industry on similar software programs you become used to using a select few programs - and risk not being exposed to the wider IT landscape.</p>
<p>
I'm expecting to learn about the modern IT industry including specific tools and platforms that utilised throughout the industry, as well as on a more micro level about specific programming tools, communication software for teams as well as ethical and business issues that need to be addressed in a hugely popular and growing industry.
</p>


<h1>Ideal Job</h1>
<p>

The job I've referred to is an advertisement for a Chief Technical Officer at a start-up software company building community-powered solar solutions: <br><br>
(https://www.seek.com.au/job/41196547?type=standard#searchRequestToken=f64bb402-8246-4184-ad85-95995207605e) <br><br>
This role from an IT perspective would mean working with emerging technologies as well as having the autonomy to establish processes and procedures from a technical standpoint. Given that the role is with a start-up I'd assume that there is a great opportunity to build from the 'ground up' in determining the IT roadmap and architecture, managing and guiding the development teams within the company as well as setting organisational goals. This position appeals to me given that it is an environmentally responsible company providing real value to people by being a disrupter in a major industry (the power/energy sector).</P>
<p>
The skills required would include a mix of technical and managerial as well as an employment history in a similar role. The required technical skills include a range of programming languages, service architecture, agile development procedures and experience in managing a technical team. The experience needed for this type of position would be extensive and would be considered a senior role. 
</p>
<p>
Personally, my current skillset would require a significant improvement as well as more experience in the IT industry before being able to apply for this role. In the past I've worked with some basic programming languages (SQL, C++) as well as managed client data on SQL Server and cloud-based architecture (Azure, Rackspace). More extensive knowledge with programming languages would be required as well as experience in working in product development and roadmap initiatives. The management aspect of the role would come with experience in the industry as well as additional courses and/or degrees focused on managing teams. </p>
<p>
Achieving the required skills and qualifications would need to start with a Bachelor in Information Technology, focusing on a development major.
Additionally, leadership and management qualifications may also be required, ideally already being established in the industry I would seek these out in conjunction with my management team and colleagues in a way that would help me progress in my role and industry. Experience is more difficult to quantify but ensuring that I'm open to new opportunities and varying my skill set is a must, as well as ensuring that my skills are always up to date.

<h2>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</h2>
<p>
The results are very interesting, although possibly to be taken with a grain of salt given their online nature. However, I think a lot of the questions are thought-provoking and the results actually paint a different picture as to how I think of myself in regard to personality. I think that these type of questions may also vary depending on the scenario you find yourself in, I know that the answers for some of these questions would be different depending on whether I was around a group of close friends versus being in a work scenario such as a meeting or dealing with a client.
</p>


<h2>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</h2>
<p>
I don't think these results will influence my behaviour within a team too drastically, I'd still deal with meeting new people, organising project tasks and providing/asking for assistance in a similar way to how I have in the past. However granted I've scored higher in some of the more organising and logically thinking personality traits it may mean I take on some of these responsibilities during the group project.
</p>

<h2>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h2>
<p>
When forming a team, it's important to have a variety of personalities and skill-sets so that tasks can be distributed evenly and accordingly to peoples strengths and abilities. Having 6 people who all share the same personality sets, IT interests and skills will mean that there are certain areas of the project that will suffer as well as people will feel over or under-utilised which won't be helpful in achieving overall success with the project.

<h1>
Project </h1>

<h2>Overview </h2>
<p>
Developing a mobile-based social media application that allows connection with like-minded individuals to participate in fitness-based activities. With the threat of gyms closing, local sports competitions shut-down and even people looking to share content and at-home workouts there will be a severe lack of options available for people to continue to exercise and participate in group fitness. The application would be easy to use, non-intrusive from a privacy perspective and allow users to tailor what they see based on activities, exercise, distance and gender. Conforming to government guidelines regarding social distancing will be a requirement, as such outdoor activities such as running, swimming, or limiting interaction/number of people would be a key feature. Using Java to develop this application for smartphones would provide a flexible and familiar UI, and being the official language for Android would ensure there is sufficient resources and support available for any issues encountered.</p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p> 
The social impact of the covid-19 virus means that people's lifestyle regarding exercise has the potential to be severely impacted. The closure of gyms, shutting down of local sports competitions and impact of social-distancing policies will mean that you will soon have to look elsewhere in order to find like-minded people looking to exercise, provide content and guidelines as well as generally still feel connected to an aspect of your life that may be impacted. </p>
<h2>
Description </h2>
<p>
The smartphone application will provide users with a sleekly designed UI developed using Java that will be compatible across both Android and iOS device. I'll focus on 5 key areas of the application in this description: Home, Interests, 'Find my Activity' and Feed and Messages. </p>
<p>
<b>Home:</b> Upon downloading and installation users will be prompted to enter some basic information that will be used to create their profile and populate their own home page on the application. This would be limited to a short description, location, name and age. It is aimed to be as less intrusive as possible and not require a lot of detailed information - or linking with other social media accounts. This is intended to alleviate any privacy concerns that users may have, and also to streamline the sign-up process and increase the user base.<br>

<b>Interests:</b> Users will be required to select exercises and activities they would be interested in participating in socially with other users. This may include swimming, running, strength training, yoga etc. This selection along with the user's location will allow the app to suggest an activity that directly relates to the user's preferences. <br>

<b>'Find my activity'</b> This module will provide user's the ability to either create an activity they intend to 'lead or host' or search for other activities application user's have already created that are upcoming. Date, time, location, description are all requirements as well as a maximum number of attendees (in order to comply with social distancing measures). Once a user is 'matched' or finds an activity they wish to attend they can apply and leave a short message for the creator of the activity - which will then need to be approved. This means that the original creator has the final say on attendees and can approve/reject user's as they wish. Once accepted the details of the activity will be provided the user both via a message and will no also appear in the user's 'feed' module of the application. <br>

<b>Feed:</b> In order to compete and also provide familiarity with other social media platforms there will be a 'feed' module as part of this application. This will provide users who have connected with other users and activities a platform to share content (e.g. home workouts, fitness information, articles) as well as information on upcoming activities that a user may have agreed to attend. Ideally this content could also incorporate industry-specific articles, news etc. through and RSS-type feed that could pull content. This would be user flexible, with the primary idea to share content and keep users updated with upcoming activities and connected with other users of the application.<br>

<b>Messages:</b> Finally, a module that would provide the ability to send user-to-user messages (provided they have connected in the past). As mentioned, when activities are created and applied for this would be confirmed or rejected via a message. Additionally, messages from the application developer such as new updates, important announcements and new version releases would also be shared here.</p>



<h2>Tools & Technologies </h2>
<p>
The application would be developed using Java and due to the application being mobile-based will result in a low dependency on extensive hardware - basically a compatible laptop/PC with the relevant software such as Eclipse is really all that will be required for the development of the application. The application would be hosted on a cloud server such as Azure App Service, meaning that the cost of hosting the application would be relevant to the number of users as well as any data storage that is required. </p>

<h2>Skills Required</h2>
<p>
Proficiency in coding in Java will be the skill most needed from a software development standpoint. However, depending on the complexity of the application and/or more advanced features that may be required (emails, location services, messaging tools, RSS feeds) additional software skills will probably also need to be investigated and learned. Being a cloud-based solution some of the hardware skills will be automated, however a knowledge of basic database management and prior experience with cloud computing would also be expected. Given that Java is a very popular programming language and cloud computing is surpassing on-premise hardware most providers are extremely competent and seek to reduce complexity for the end-user/administrator as much as possible which means that upskilling for a project like this would be achievable. </p>

<h2>Outcome</h2>
<p> 
If the application is successful, this will provide a social media platform for fitness participants that is able to connect people who are interested in similar activities as others without the need for gyms and organised mass-market sporting competitions. Given the current climate and restrictions/closures around these venues and organisations it will it offer users a safe platform to arrange activities and still be able to have an active lifestyle during a time of crisis. Ideally this development will help people with their mental health and provide a healthy outlet whilst still complying with any government recommendations throughout the covid-19 pandemic. </p>
